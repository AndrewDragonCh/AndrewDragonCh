### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making a tutorial series for vexcode for the VEX Robotics Competition.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning both JavaScript and C++, along with Unreal Engine 5 and Blender.

I'm always working on Minecraft Servers, so don't mind me. If you want plugins through Spigot, use either https://github.com/PaperMC https://papermc.io/ or https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur https://purpur.pl3x.net/. For a management panel, if you have some technical knowledge, use https://github.com/pterodactyl https://pterodactyl.io/. For a good forums, use https://github.com/NamelessMC https://namelessmc.com/.
