### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making a tutorial series for vexcode for the VEX Robotics Competition. My school switched to this program, and being the best programmer, its my duty to make sure my friends know how to use it.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning both JavaScript and C++, along with Unreal Engine 5 and Blender.

I'm always working on Minecraft Servers, so don't mind me. If you want plugins through Spigot, use either https://github.com/PaperMC https://papermc.io/ or https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur https://purpur.pl3x.net/. For a management panel, if you have some technical knowledge, use https://github.com/pterodactyl https://pterodactyl.io/. For a good forums, use https://github.com/NamelessMC https://namelessmc.com/.
