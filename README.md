### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on how to get https://github.com/Dragory/ZeppelinBot up and running. There are no instructions on how to self host it, and the developers won't help either.

I'm always working on Minecraft Servers, so don't mind me. If you want plugins through Spigot, use either https://github.com/PaperMC https://papermc.io/ or https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur https://purpur.pl3x.net/. For a management panel, if you have some technical knowledge, use https://github.com/pterodactyl https://pterodactyl.io/. For a good forums, use https://github.com/NamelessMC https://namelessmc.com/.
